# Capstone Project: Credit Risk Modeling

## Sponsor organization name: Deloitte Consulting

Artificial intelligence tools are already being deployed across financial institutions to help make
lending decisions. The design, data collection, feature selection, model build, model evaluation, and
model production stages of the model lifecycle are analyzed for fairness and bias. Technical
solutions including variable repair and the model accuracy-model fairness tradeoff should be
discussed, alongside process-oriented and policy recommendations

## Objectives/deliverables:
1. Analyze the German Credit Risk dataset for potential bias along example sensitive attributes:
gender, race, and age.
2. Analyze the premise of creating a mortgage lending model for the Single Family, Primary
Residence, First Mortgage segment for potential of unfair treatment of different classes and
inequitable outcomes.
3. Interpret and share model output by exploring Explainable AI techniques and open-source
libraries
4. Demonstrate and interpret model results in a visual dashboard or presentation
Description of dataset(s):

In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified
as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. The link to the original dataset can be
found below.

## Preferred Software/Tools:
